Personal statement
________________________________________
I feel that I would be suitable for the role in question as I consider myself a hardworking,
dedicated and resourceful individual. I have lots of transferable skills that I can bring to this position,
for example in my previous job I worked within a warehouse, taking deliveries and stacking shelves.
I also know a fair amount about technology as I have been an IT student for 6 years,
although I mainly work with and around computers I have a level of understand of technology that the average person may not have.
I like to think of myself as a very straightforward person,
when working I always strive to complete the set task to the best of my ability. In my spare time I like to game,
I’m an avid photographer and I also really enjoy cooking.
