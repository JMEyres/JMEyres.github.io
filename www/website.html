      This project was my assignment for my digital technologies unit, for my games software engineering course at bournemouth university.
      The brief was to make a portfolio website that had at least 3 different web pages with images on them. This website also needed to have a consistent header and footer across each of the pages.
      Finally the website also needed to make use of an external CSS file to style the elements.
