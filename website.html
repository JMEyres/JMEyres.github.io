      This project was my assignment for my digital technologies unit, for my games software engineering course at bournemouth university.
      The brief was to make a portfolio website that had at least 3 different web pages with images on them. This website also needed to have a consistent header and footer across each of the pages.
      Finally the website also needed to make use of an external CSS file to style the elements.

    <img src="images/Website.PNG" style="	position: relative; left:17%; width:80vw; height:38vw; border:0.3vw; border-style:groove; border-color: darkgrey;"alt="Image of website home page">

    <br>
    <br>

    <p style="margin-top:0%;">
      Shown above is the home page for my website i decided to try and a clean and professional look for this website because it was for my portfolio, and i am planning on continuing to use it as such.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0%;">
      For this website we were also encouraged within the brief to attempt to implement an advanced javascript feature, i chose to make a small game using the canvas element.
      This is shown in the image below.

    <footer style="background-color: darkgrey;">Email: s5304176@bournemouth.ac.uk</footer>
