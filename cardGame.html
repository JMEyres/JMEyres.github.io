      This project was my assignment for my Games Design Principles unit, for my games software engineering course at bournemouth university.
      The brief for this project was to get into a group of four and make either a card game or a board game. We chose to make a card game as we felt it would be more interesting.
      For this game we had to design a game of our choosing, regularly meet and record any progress that has been made.
      We then also had to make a ten minute video presenting our game. Within this video we had to explain why our game delivers meaningful play,
      Describe the design in terms of a formal framework (FFE or MDA), and then two or maybe more of:

2.  Use of probability and uncertainty
3.  Puzzle design
4.  Information design
5.  Elegant rule design and table top best practice
6.  Considerations for game difficulty and complexity
7.  Game balance

      I tasked myself with designing and creating some cards to use within our game, the designs are shown below.
